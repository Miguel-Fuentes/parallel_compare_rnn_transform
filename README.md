# parallel_compare_rnn_transform
Udel Cisc 372 project, compare the parallel scaling of lstm models compared to transformer models to evaluate the claim that transformers parallelize better than RNNs

Note that the code for the models all comes from official PyTorch examples here: https://github.com/pytorch/examples
